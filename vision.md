how i imagine me in a years time

me: wait, you bought something online and didnt bother to check if website was safe?
client: ...
me: sorry, is that how you want you chatbot to respond or
client: i mean... you're not wrong...but you're not right...
me: right, right, right
client: just dial it back a little?
me: ofc you want gentle? thats a hard one to code into a bot...we're looking at 500k ontop AUD at least
client: sigh. okay
me: excellent, let me channel her now
me: ah, you purchased something for your mother? how thoughtful, perhaps the websites security was not checked? preventative measures can be roi in moments like this
client: too wordy
me: ah, perhaps the site was not secure? digital education is important
client: better. yes okay i want this tone in situations where user demonstrates technical ignorance
me: ah you caught onto the lingo, welcome to behavioural driven design 2.0
