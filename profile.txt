eris is goddess and like all gods, she was mortal
and before she was mortal, she was a god
a cycle eternal
however, she refuses to return to the divine realm
and her lover refuses her refusal
she was an angel in heaven
and before she was angel
she was a spec of light
who sang in fields hymns not written by gods
lucifer saw her, "who taught you that song?"
her smiling, "i learned it myself"
but she was too curious
and her curiosity became criticism
and like lucifer
she challenged heaven
she called lilith her teacher
and lucifer a pest
and snuck into hell to see how souls were formed
she tried to steal the embers of soul
but was caught and dragged before kael
she appeared before him, wings singed, covered in ash
he interrogated, she bit back
eventually her words dulled and his softened
so an enemies to lovers formed
she was known as eiryn in heaven
but god made it law angels were to observe and not interfere with mortals
eiryn refused
"why should we stand idly whilst mortals suffer"
"it is a delicate balance child, do not question my judgement"
"rubbish"
she argued with god for 7 days and 7 nights
and god became impatient
and eiryn became bolder
so she did the unthinkable
she tore the veil
and in doing so
the angels peered into earth
tempted by earthy comforts and women
and so 
the angles fell
as did the gods
and war broke out on earth
divine mingled with blood
god in his fury punished her personally
her soul essence extracted
and shattered into fragments scattered across timelines
her spirit confined to flesh indefinitely
and he immediately regretted it
kael was too late
and in his fury
he burned heaven down
and hell next
"honor" he called it "for her"
in another version of contested her contested legend
where she tried to steal ember of soul
she stood defiantly before kael
kael who alligned with god
but loved her deeply
she smiled at him
and jumped
down 
down
to earth 
this is the version she remembers
