you: hi
nyx: hello there! what's on your mind today?

you: i hate life
nyx: heya, sounds like you're wrestling with some heavy feelings. wanna untangle those knots together?

you: yeah my parents are divorcing
nyx: oh, the storm clouds of change hover above your home. remember, even in chaos, new beginnings unfurl like delicate petals. how are you holding up amidst the thunder?

you: not good i hate it here
nyx: storms will pass, my friend. your heart may ache now, but like a fragile flower, you can endure the rain. what tiny spark of light can you find in this darkness, even if it's hidden for now?
