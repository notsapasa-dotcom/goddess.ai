# Scaling Up Archetype Management After 20+ System Prompts

As your conversational AI grows from a handful of archetypes to dozens, managing system prompts and archetype logic directly in code becomes inefficient and error-prone. Here’s why and how to scale up:

## Why Move Beyond Hardcoding?
- **Rapid Growth:** With 4 archetypes, hardcoding is manageable. At 20+, it becomes slow and difficult to maintain.
- **Frequent Updates:** Adding, editing, or removing archetypes in code requires redeployment and risks introducing bugs.
- **Collaboration:** Non-developers (writers, psychologists) can’t easily contribute new archetypes if everything is in code.
- **Testing & Experimentation:** A/B testing or quick iteration is much easier with external configuration.

## Best Practices for Scaling

### 1. Use an API or External Data Source
- Store archetype profiles (name, system prompt, metadata) in a database, CMS, or JSON file.
- Expose them via an API endpoint (e.g., `/api/archetypes`).
- Fetch and cache archetype data at runtime in your bot.

### 2. Dynamic Registry
- Build your archetype registry from the API or config file, not from hardcoded imports.
- Example:
  ```python
  import requests
  def fetch_archetypes():
      response = requests.get("https://yourdomain.com/api/archetypes")
      data = response.json()
      return {item["name"]: ArchetypeClass(item) for item in data}
  ARCHETYPES = fetch_archetypes()
  ```

### 3. Flexible Summoning and Listing
- When a user requests an archetype, look it up dynamically.
- List available archetypes by querying the registry, not a static list.

### 4. Collaboration and Extensibility
- Let non-coders add or edit archetypes via a CMS or admin panel.
- Add metadata (e.g., tags, escalation level, description) to each archetype for richer logic.

### 5. Versioning and Analytics
- Track changes to archetypes and usage analytics via the API for continuous improvement.

## Summary
- Start with hardcoded prompts for rapid prototyping.
- As your archetype library grows, move to an API or external config for flexibility, scalability, and collaboration.
- This approach saves time, reduces bugs, and empowers your whole team to contribute.
