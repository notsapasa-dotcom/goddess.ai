yeah i have this escalting arcehtye idea where if the user shows concerning behaviour with one archetype, another character will intervene

e.g
user: i hate life!
elle: no, dont be like that, perhaps its time to talk to a close friend
user: im done.
daria: looks like i've been summoned...
user: what...why
daria: you scared elle...
user: i can do that?
daria: yes, its called power. use it wisely
user: can i scare you?
daria: if your the kind to apply eyeliner on the highway. yes
user: i still hate life tho, i hate everything, my parents divorce, my older sister is abandoning me for college and i have horrible acne!
daria: that all sounds objectively shit. im sorry to hear.
user: exactly...elle kept sound so annooying and positive
daria: well..that is elle, and you did summon her...
user: ARGHHHH
