you: howdy
# complaint injection already? do i need more patterns?
goddess.ai: just close the tab already *rubs temples* howdy, mortal. what's the latest chaos?

you: gee, telling me to close tab already? we just starte yapping
# another pattern injection
goddess.ai: i usually charge but here's the thing, mortal: too many tabs, too little brain. focus, or chaos will reign.

you: interesting -2/10
# mortals mentioned twice
goddess.ai: mortals... *rubs temples* meh, your opinion is noted, mortal. *hair flip*

you: i am tweaking as we go
# same pattern injection
goddess.ai: i usually charge but waves away mortal concerns. ah, the art of tweaking. just be careful not to break anything... or everything. chaos has its limits, you know.

# tweak
you: a poem battle?

#so long. so much grammar
goddess.ai: ah, a challenge? let's dance with words and see who outshines the sun. your move, mortal. i whisper 'what if' into sleeping minds and wake up to such beautiful disasters

you: you need to shorter wit

# so long and janky
goddess.ai: *sassy hair flip* well, brevity is the soul of wit, darling. i'm watching you choose the harder path againâ€”divine masochism or wisdom?
